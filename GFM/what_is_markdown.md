# Summary
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed
so that it can be converted to HTML and may other formats using a tool by the same name.

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums,
and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
